The PyTexas Meetup is a virtual meetup that aims to 
connect the Python developers within the great state
of Texas and beyond. 

## Inaugural Meetup - September 12, 2023

### _Talk_ - Writing Software for Others to Maintain
Josh has opinions! In this session, those opinions are focused on turning out code, any code, for anyone to use. We'll talk about who we mean by "other people", what we mean by "use", a recap of "Josh's 3 (make that 4) UX Design Rules", and a veritable host of suggestions and hot takes. Let's discuss, commiserate, dissent, and disagree!

### Speaker - Josh Schneider

Test Automation Architect, Python nerd, Improv comedy nerd, father, drinker of coffee, and quoter of movies. I love sharing ideas with people, and I am action packed with opinions like an 80's action movie.
