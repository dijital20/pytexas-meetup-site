## Upcoming PyTexas Meetups


### _Inaugural Meetup - September 12, 2023_

#### _Talk:_  Oh the (Methods) You Can (Make): By Dunder Seuss - Josh Cannon

You can make many methods  
Over 100 to be exact  
That start with two underscores  
What do you think of that?  

The runtime, it calls these  
At points A or B  
To do special magic  
At runtime, you see.  

You may have seen \_\_getattr\_\_ or \_\_init\_\_  
But \_\_rfloordiv\_\_? What’s the point of it?  

Come take a quick tour, your mother won’t mind  
And hear a talk that’s one-of-a-kind  
About how Python uses them under-the-hood  
And how you can use them to write code that's real good  

_TJosh is an avid lover of tooling that accelerates developers, including being a maintainer of the Polyglot Open-Source Build System: Pants. In his free time, Josh enjoys laser cutting/engraving and his wonderful family._

Neutron Sync is a new open source command line utility for synchronizing your sensitive key files and personal configurations. Sharing your sensitive files across machines can help you manage your secrets more easily, provide a backup mechanism, and help you setup new environments quicker.

_Paul Bailey is a web developer with a background in aerospace engineering. He is currently a Chief Software Architect with Cognitive Space where he oversees the development of applications being used for satellite mission control and operations. He has many years of experience speaking and running meetups in the open source community. In addition to being a Web and aerospace geek, he is a father of three and can cook a pretty mean pizza from scratch. He holds a BS in Aerospace Engineering from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University._

#### _Talk:_ PEP Talk - Mariatta

If you use Python, chances are you've heard of PEP 8, the Python style guide.

But do you know what PEPs really are? PEPs are more than just a style guide. A PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It's a proposal documentation for when you want to change the Python programming language in a big way, for example when you want to change the syntax of Python. Think of the addition of f-strings, the walrus operator, or the ExceptionGroup, those changes all started with a PEP.

Let's have a PEP talk, where you can learn about the PEP process, what needs a PEP and what doesn't, and how you as community members can take part.

*Mariatta is a Python core developer where she focuses on improving the workflow and documentation. She is active in the Python community as an advisor for the Global PyLadies, co-founder of PyCascades, and is currently chairing PyCon US conference.
For her contributions to the Python and community, she received the PSF Community Service Award in 2018 and Google Open Source Peer Bonus Award in 2017 and 2022.*
